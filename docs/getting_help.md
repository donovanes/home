# Getting Programming Help

## Your Code Will Break
As you may have already learned from your virtual environment set up and surviving the python installation process, things will go wrong. Come in to your code space expecting the bugs to show up. The bugs will show up before any usable solution does. This mindset will help you save hours of frustration when your code does not work the first, second, or third time around. 

## Ask GOOD Questions: 
When asking for help with your code, saying 'my code is not working' is an unclear problem. Framing the issue as such makes it tricky to address the problem effectively. Use the GOOD Questions model so that all parties have clarity on what they are tackling.

* **G:** Give context to your issue - clearly describe the problem.
* **O:** Outline the steps you've taken to solve it.
* **O:** Offer your best guess about what the bug is. This will help you think through the problem. It will also make the process easier for the person assisting you.
* **D:** Demo what is happening. Keep track of the error messages you've gotten, plus the code implemented to create the error, as well as any steps you may have taken to fix it.

## Resources
In most cases, chances are someone on the internet has already faced your same issue (or a very similar one). 
**Google and pages like Stack Overflow are your best friends in your coding journey. **

Here are some other resources you may try:
## Semi-Live

* **r/learnpython** this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/) can be great for crowd-sourcing solutions to your coding issues. Some programmers prefer to use StackOverflow, but python subreddits are a bit friendlier for new coders. StackOverflow can have coding solutions that are difficult to understand for new programmers, and thus can leave you confused about how to adjust the code to fit your unique problem.

* **Python Tutor** this [website](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) can be a great place to find live help if you are stuck on a particular bug. Beware: Like you, there will be several other new coders that need help. Thus, this website tends to have long wait periods - not ideal for being on deadline. 

* **Python Discord Chat** this [Discord Chat](https://discordapp.com/invite/python) can be awesome for getting help from new and experienced programmers alike. People will definitely want to help, but they are hesitant to do so if it seems like you have not taken any steps to fix the bugs yourself. Do your due diligence before asking for help on this chat, or any of the other resources.

### YouTube

* **SentDex** this [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) has a good python beginner series where basic concepts are explained. More importantly, he has several projects that you can follow along - showing you what is possible once you get the fundamentals down.
