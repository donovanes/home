## Setting up Virtual Box

**Note:** If your laptop is on the CPI domain you may need to set up some time with CTD to go through this install as at points administrator permission may be needed.

1. Once you have [installed Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_6_1) click on the installation drive and press *Next* to start the installation.

2. First it will ask us what features we want to install and where we want to install them. In our case, it is best to leave the default settings as indicated by the installer. 
Click *Next* again to proceed to the next step.

3. Secondly, it will ask us if we want to add an icon to the desktop, the taskbar, etc. This selection does not interfere with the software's functioning, so feel free to select what you want. However, it is recommended to at least create a desktop shortcut. You may also want to create an entry in the Windows menu and "Restiger file associations" to set VirtualBox as the default when opening files of its type.

4. In the following step, it will ask us if we want to proceed with the installation. VirtualBox will warn us that during the installation process it is possible that our machine's internet connection will drop. Make sure to save anything important that may be using internet connection before proceeding to the next step. 
To continue with the install press *Yes*.

Throughout this process, a window may appear to grant the installer administrator permissions. These are the necessary permissions that Windows needs to allow programs to install. We grant access and proceed with the installation.
The following window will ask you if you want to install the software driver. A software driver is a "program" that allows the operating system to communicate correctly with the hardware. In this case we will need it, so click on *Install*.
